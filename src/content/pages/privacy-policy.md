# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 13 September 2024

At Vilbot, we prioritize your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how we handle and protect any personal information you may provide when using our services.

## Website Privacy

Our website is solely designed to display information about Vilbot. We do not track or collect any personal information from users who visit our site. No third-party cookies or tracking services are used.

## Discord Bot Privacy

Vilbot does not collect any additional information beyond what is provided by the official Discord API. The data used by Vilbot is limited to the information of users within a Discord guild that has added the bot. This information is solely used for the internal functioning of the bot and is not shared with any third parties.

## Data Usage

Vilbot only accesses and uses the data provided by Discord (such as user IDs, usernames, and server information) to ensure the bot functions properly within Discord guilds where it is present. No personal data is stored or used for purposes outside of the bot's operation.
